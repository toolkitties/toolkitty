# Toolkitty (working title) ðŸ˜»

### P2P offline-first autonomous coordination toolkit for collectives, organisers and venues to share resources and organise events in a shared calendar.

Toolkitty is built for iOS, Android and Desktop with Tauri, SvelteKit and P2Panda.

## About

Toolkitty is a peer-to-peer (P2P), offline-first toolkit designed to help collectives, festivals, organizers, venues and community spaces by facilitating decentralized resource exchanging and event coordination in a shared calendar. We are building it for groups that value autonomy, resilience, and privacy in their organizational practices.

### Key features

- **Peer-to-Peer Networking.** Using P2Panda under the hood, networking is done directly between peers instead of using a centralised server.

- **Offline-First Functionality.** Data is stored locally and synced to peers when an internet connection is available. Ensuring you can organise no matter what environment you are in.

- **Resource Sharing.** Easy to list, discover and manage shared resources like spaces and tools or equipment, encouraging sustainable and collaborative practices.

- **Shared Calendar and Events.** Plan your venue, festival, collective through a shared calendar.

- **Encryption.** All data is encrypted on your device by default and can only be synced with verified peers.
